# Arithmetic Expression Calculator UI
This is a graphical interface to the  arithmetic-expr-calculator library I developed on npm which  supports:

> The generation of Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix and Prefix) expression form of an arithmetic expression in (Infix) form.

> Performs the computation of the arithmetic expression if Integers or Floating point numbers are used in the expression.
